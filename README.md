### Hi ðŸ˜€

Welcome to my g i t h u b space. If you have a question about anything, feel free to email â€“ just bear in mind that I usually don't have a lot of time or willpower to troubleshoot problems with most of my old projects.

Currently I'm working on some new secret projects ðŸ”¨, and perhaps in the future I'd have more to share on here.

I'm also in the market for work. If you have a cool remote opportunity, I'd probably be interested.
